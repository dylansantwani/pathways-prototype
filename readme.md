This is the pathways app prototype for naperville central software engineering's class.

This app helps high school students see which diploma pathway endorsements they’re working toward, which requirements they’ve already completed, and what they still need.
Right now, this information is often spread across counselors, course catalogs, and different school systems. The Pathways Portal brings it together in one place so students don’t have to guess or rely on memory.
Pathway endorsements are official recognitions added to a student’s diploma. They show focus in areas like STEM, Business, Health Sciences, Arts & Humanities, or Career and Technical Education, and can help show interests and strengths to colleges or employers.
The app is designed to support awareness and self-tracking. It’s not meant to replace counselors, but to help students have clearer, more informed conversations with them.
